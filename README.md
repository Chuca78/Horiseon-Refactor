# Mini-Project-01 Webpage

## Description

This is the mini project 01 for the UT Austin coding boot camp. I was given the index.html and style.css for a website that was mostly working. This type of project is called an "on the job ticket" where I was given existing code and the challenge was to refactor the code. I found multiple duplications in the style.css and was able to consolidate these into one class. I discovered that one of the links was broken, so I added an id to fix this issue. Also, none of the pictures had alt tags, and the company logo was not aria compliant, so i remedied these issues.
